# Data_Analysis_Project
The project is about analyzing Olympic data using Python, focusing on athlete participation, sport-related costs, and various data visualization techniques using key Python libraries.

Key Pointers:-
1. Modern Olympic Games feature both summer and winter sports with global participation.
2. Key Python modules pandas data analysis, numpy array processing, matplotlib numerical 
   mathematics, seaborn statistical visualization.
3. Steps in analysis import libraries, understand databases two CSV files, clean and format data 
   using pandas' read_csv.
4. Initial data inspection using head, describe, and info functions.
5. Merge dataframes using pd.merge.
6. Create a dataframe for gold medalists by filtering the merged dataframe.
7. Create a countplot to visualize gold medals by age using matplotlib and seaborn.
8. Visualize women's participation in the Summer Olympics over different years, showing an 
   increase.
9. Generate a bar graph to display top countries by gold medals using Seaborn's catplot.
10.Create a point plot to analyze the weight of male weightlifters over different years.
11.Customize graphs with labels and titles, e.g., "Medal Per Country" and "Weight Year Male 
   Lifter".
